        I am an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Department at Kuwait University. My research focuses on developing innovative models with practical applications in social media analytics, low-resource languages, and public health. 

        I apply a range of qualitative and quantitative methods to investigate the efficacy of graph-based models in behavioral modeling.
