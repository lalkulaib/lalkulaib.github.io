        I'm an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Kuwait University. My research focuses on developing innovative models with practical applications in social media analytics, behavioral modeling, and public health.
        
        I apply a range of qualitative and quantitative methods to comprehensively investigate the role of graph-based models and Deep Learning in understanding and interpreting the complexities of human language and online behavior, with a specific interest in low-resource languages.
